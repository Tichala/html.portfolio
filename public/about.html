<p>I am a full-stack developer with a strong focus on building scalable, user-centered web applications from end to end. 
  I enjoy working across the entire stack, designing intuitive frontend interfaces while developing reliable, efficient 
  backend systems that power them</p>

<p>My experience includes working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, as well as server-side development, databases, and APIs. 
  I prioritize clean architecture, performance, and maintainable code, ensuring that applications are both robust and easy to evolve over time.</p>

  Whether working independently or as part of a team, I strive to deliver solutions that are technically sound, practical, and aligned with real-world user needs.</p>
