<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time </h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Sherlock Holmes - A Game of Shadows</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of the analytical and logical thinking employed by the protagonist.</p>

<h3>Blended</h3>
<p>Adam Sandler really brought the big guns out on this one. It's a very funny movie centred around blended family dynamics </p>

<h3>The Tomorrow war</h3>
<p>This is one of the best Sci-fi movies I have ever watched. In a bid to save the current world from annihilation by an extra terrestrial species, Soldiers from the current world are sent into the past to try and stop the war before it even starts. The plot twist is just on point. </p>
